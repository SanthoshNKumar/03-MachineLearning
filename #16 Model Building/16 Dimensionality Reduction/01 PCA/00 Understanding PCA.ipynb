    "The amount of data generated each day from sources such as scientific experiments, cell phones, and smartwatches has been growing exponentially over the last several years. Not only are the number data sources increasing, but the data itself is also growing richer as the number of features in the data increases. Datasets with a large number of features are called high-dimensional datasets.\n",

Another example is user movie ratings, where the features are movies rated, and where the number of dimensions increases as the user rates more of them.\n",

We know that machine learning models can be used to classify or cluster data in order to predict future events. However, high-dimensional datasets add complexity to certain machine learning models (i.e. linear models) and, as a result, models that train on datasets with a large number features are more prone to producing error due to bias."
